A = **I made the Upizin Group Two years ago, January 18th, 2023 (1/18/2023), The issue: at the time the games we playedâ€” Used Pubic chat, meaning if we speak in a known language, Everyone would be able to hear us, Solution: Make another language of course ðŸ˜‚, I came up with kL, a: Fast, Convenient, Effective, easy to-learn language, now I want to share it with you!**

Q = *What does kL mean?*
A = **This is my favorite question, and it might surprise you! kL used to be FCU (Fast Communication in Upizin), but eventually we stopped playing the game we did (around the official release of kL), so I decided to make it my own language and not just a language for Upizin, then came kL, why kL though? I go by "Kiyoshi" (Typically), "Yoshi" (by Close friends) "Kiy" and "Kiyo" (short for Kiyoshi), so the first reason of the "k" in kL is that it symbolizes my name online, second reason, if you flip it, it becomes "Lk", meaning Language Knowledge, third, the most commonly known reason: Kiyoshi's languageâ€” that's literally the main reason kL = Kiyoshi's language. Why the uppercase L? well; first of all it looks amazing compared to "KL" or "Kl", and also to show I put what I make, above who I am (k is small, L ((my creation) is bigger than the small k), showing humbleness.**
